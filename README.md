# MVP pattern architecture using Coroutines

It's an Android project with Kotlin implementing/exploring an MVP pattern architecture where the network calls are using  Coroutines in the Data layer with the Repository pattern. 
The Coroutines allow us to keep code more clear and concise. However, I don't know yet how to implement that data response processing that is easy to do with some functions with RxJava, that's something for a further version.
