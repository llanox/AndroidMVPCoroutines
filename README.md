# MVP pattern architecture using Coroutines
2
It's an Android project with Kotlin implementing/exploring a MVP pattern architecture where the network calls are executed with Coroutines in the Data layer with the Repository pattern. 
The Coroutines allow us keep a code more clear and concise. However, I don't know how to implement that response processing that you're able to do with some functions with RxJava.
